A common problem that we face in RESTful web services is sometimes the search API returns huge data.
E.g. Searching for users in a city may return thousands of users. Returning this while result data consumes lot of bandwidth and 
not best way. We will see how to use PagingAndSortingRepository of Spring Data to address this issue.

This project demonstrates 

1) How to create RESTful web services using Spring Boot, MongoDB.
2) How to handle exceptions and sends out correct HTTP response.
3) Generic exception handler advice.
4) How to implement RESTful API for regular field search.
5) How to implement RESTful API for nested field search.

The application can be run by running RestApplication class.

When you run RestApplication class, you will see similar message as following message:

You can use POSTMAN to test the API. I have attached the screenshots also.
